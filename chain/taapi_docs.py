RSI_API_DOCS="""Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Base URL: https://api.taapi.io/rsi

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.
The RSI provides signals that tell investors to buy when the security or currency is oversold and to sell when it is overbought. 

API parameters:
secret: The secret which is emailed to you when you request an API key. 
Note: The secret is: {taapi_key} 
exchange: The exchange you want to calculate the indicator from: gateio or one of our supported exchanges. For other crypto / stock exchanges, please refer to our Client or Manual integration methods.
symbol: Symbol names are always uppercase, with the coin separated by a forward slash and the market: COIN/MARKET. For example: BTC/USDT Bitcoin to Tether, or LTC/BTC Litecoin to Bitcoin...
interval: Interval or time frame: We support the following time frames: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 12h, 1d, 1w. So if you're interested in values on hourly candles, use interval=1h, for daily values use interval=1d, etc.

More examples:
Let's say you want to know the rsi value on the last closed candle on the 30m timeframe. You are not interest in the real-time value, so you use the backtrack=1 optional parameter to go back 1 candle in history to the last closed candle.
